# InformationRetrievalUsingSemanticSimilarity_BERT_ClinicalBERT_Covid19

When a new virus is discovered and causes a pandemic, it is important for scientists to get information coming from all scientific sources that may help them combat the pandemic. The challenge, however, is that the number of scientific papers created is large and the papers are published very rapidly, making it nearly impossible for scientists to digest and understand whatâ€™s important in this mass of data. We have developed and discussed a cosine similarity model, a deep learning model and a corpus specific scientific literature understanding system that can take in common terms and analyze a very large corpus of scientific papers and return highly relevant text excerpts from papers containing topical data relating to the common text inputted, allowing a single researcher to gather targeted information and quickly answer important questions about the new virus. We have developed and discussed an evaluation metric to identify the best performing IR algorithm in this paper.


### Models Implemented: 
1) Feature engineering using TF-IDF weights with Cosine Similarity metric

2) Transformer based BERT model with contextual BERT Embeddings

3) Clinical Bert Model Pre- Trained on the MED_STS Database
